# BattleCode-Primer

The aim of this project is to analyze, develop and implement AI strategies into AI 'players', so that they are able to manage resurces and 
compete for those resources against other players.

The strategies developed are implemented and their performance is tested, by using the real-time strategy game [Battlecode](https://www.battlecode.org/).

The benchmark used to test the performance of the AI players is by measuring how many AI players, chosen from a selected list of 
top teams of Battlecode 2017, are beaten.
